# ColTrack

## The code has been moved to [bytedance/ColTrack](https://github.com/bytedance/ColTrack).

#### ColTrack not only outperforms state-of-the-art methods on large-scale datasets under high frame rates but also achieves higher and more stable performance under low frame rates. This allows it to obtain a higher equivalent FPS by reducing the frame rate requirement.
